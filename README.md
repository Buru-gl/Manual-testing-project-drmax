# Final Project for Manual Testing - IT Factory

Hello! My name is M. BuruianÄƒ and I will present a project for manual testing, part of the manual testing course at IT Factory Academy.  

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: https://www.drmax.ro/

API Documentation:

**The final project will be split into 2 sections: [[Testing section](https://github.com/Buru-gl/Manual-testing-project-drmax#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](https://github.com/NCOor8/ProiectTestaremanuala/blob/main/README.md#2-sql-section).**

Tools used: Jira ([Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)), for Jira we use [Zephyr](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1014681/zephyr-squad-test-management-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
